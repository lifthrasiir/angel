- **Project:** Angel - A personalized coding agent using Go and React/TypeScript.
- **Goal:** Create a simple, single-user web version of `@google/gemini-cli`.
- **Language:** Code and comments should be in English. Respond to the user in their requested language.
- **Terminology:** The terms "agent" or "angel" refer to the LLM model.
- **Development:** Features may require modifications to both the Go and TypeScript code. `go fmt` after any Go modifications.
- **Build:** `npm run build-frontend`, `npm run build-backend`, `npm run build` (both). Never run `npm start`, the user will.
- **Dependency:** Minimize. Clearly explain why any new dependency is required.
